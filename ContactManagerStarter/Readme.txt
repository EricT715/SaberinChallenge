The challenges that I tried to do was to add a new feature that was able to set a primary even with the given emails added. I also wanted to update the grid to show the
primary email address. The way I wanted it to work was that there would be a drop down saying personal or business answering the question set as primary. In the backend there
would be logic to set one as primary which I tried to do but could not figure out the right syntax. With updating the grid first I wanted to test out how to display an email
in general with the given data seed. I thought it would not be the hardest thing to do as the logic was already provided. What I tried to do was go into a loop within the
contacts loop in the html which was able to cycle through the list of emails that was in the contacts.data. I was not able to get it to show any emails and was struggling with
this for a while.

The only challenge that I was able to get done is adding the Date Of Birth input and making the Title dropdown. This was not the hardest task to do because all I had to do
was make some small HTML changes.
