The challenges that I tried to do was to add a new feature that was able to set a primary even with the given emails added. I also wanted to update the grid to show the
primary email address. There is a button that allows you to set the email as primary. There is backend logic to set that to true when to a business or personal email that is selected
as the primary email. In the emailaddress data and view model I added the public bool IsPrimary to be able to check if it is true or false. Then in the contact grid it is checking to
see if the isprimary is set to true and if it is itll show the primary email. If it was not set then the first email will show. 

I also did the challenge of adding the Date Of Birth input and making the Title dropdown. This was not the hardest task to do because all I had to do
was make some small HTML changes.
